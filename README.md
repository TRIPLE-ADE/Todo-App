## Reflection 

This was a 2days long project built for a dev internship assessment. Project goals are listed below:
    - The application should allow users to add, and delete tasks.
    - Tasks should have a title, description, and status (completed or not).
    - The status should be toggleable.
    - Additionally, the application should persist data using LocalStorage.

The technologies implemented in this project are React, React Hooks  and a significant amount of VanillaJS, JSX, and CSS. I chose to use the `vite` boilerplate to minimize
